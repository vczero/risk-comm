Abstract:   
Risk communication plays a critical role in disaster warning and management, and social media is emerging as a powerful tool for information dissemination. While substantial research exists on risk communication, studies focusing on governments as the primary subject are limited, and there is a noticeable gap in examining inter-city and city-organization emergency responses. This study aims to address these gaps by exploring and evaluating China’s governmental communication strategies during typhoon disasters. We collect typhoon-related news from the WeChat Official Accounts of 237 city governments over an entire year, alongside corresponding typhoon data for the same period. Based on this dataset, we propose an analytical framework for government risk communication. First, we design a three-stage analysis method (pre-disaster, mid-disaster, and post-disaster) based on the Disaster Management Cycle to analyze the dynamics of public engagement. Second, we develop city and organization extractors to construct city and organization response networks, offering fresh approaches to studying city collaboration and organizational coordination. Finally, leveraging large language models, we develop a title feature extractor and sentiment classification model, providing valuable insights for optimizing government media strategies. Overall, this study offers novel methods and a fresh perspective on government risk communication.   
摘要：风险传播在灾害预警和管理中起着至关重要的作用，社交媒体正日益成为信息传播的强大工具。尽管关于风险传播的研究已有大量成果，但以政府为主要研究对象的研究仍然有限，尤其是针对城市间及城市与组织间应急响应的研究存在明显空白。本研究旨在通过探索和评估中国政府在台风灾害期间的传播策略来填补这些空白。我们收集了237个城市政府微信公众号在一年内发布的台风相关信息，以及同期的台风数据。基于该数据集，我们提出了一个政府风险传播的分析框架。首先，我们基于灾害管理周期设计了一个三阶段分析方法（灾前、灾中、灾后），用于分析公众参与的动态变化。其次，我们开发了城市和组织信息提取器，以构建城市和组织响应网络，为研究城市协作和组织协调提供了新方法。最后，我们利用大型语言模型设计了标题特征提取器和情感分类模型，为优化政府媒体策略提供了洞察。总体而言，本研究为政府风险传播提供了新方法和新视角。
